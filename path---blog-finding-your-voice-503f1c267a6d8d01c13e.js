I’ve always had that movie in the back of my head and now I feel the need to do something about it.</p>\n<h2>The Web</h2>\n<p>I’m not a brilliant writer. I somewhat detest it, but I do realize the beauty of a blog medium on the web. The medium encapsulates a moment of time in the author’s life. Generally, the author writes something going on in their lives, whether it be awesome, interesting, moving, or sad.   </p>\n<p>A lot of those words describes a flurry of emotions I feel on a daily basis. Most of the time I come to a certain realization or lesson which I soon forget. What if I didn’t forget ever lesson? I like the idea of a never forgetting blog. The Internet can’t as easily forget. It’s documented and in a way, permanent.</p>\n<p>I think it’s time for me to stop daydreaming, stop the machine of learning, but then forgetting. I want to be better. We all want to be better. Encapsulation is one of the first steps for me to become better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can only become better if I remember where I was the day before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that my encapsulations amuse, interest, and even confuse you. Perhaps, we all can get better by learning together.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"01 September, 2016",title:"Finding your voice 🎤",tldr:"Ben starts a diary",path:"/blog/finding-your-voice"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog/finding-your-voice",prev:{html:'<h2>To learn Javascript</h2>\n<p>Around my Junior year of college, I wanted to learn Javascript. I already knew how to do basic D.O.M manipulation through jQuery, but I felt as though I were leaning a crutch. </p>\n<p>Around this time as well, I’ve been hearing more and more about the whole jQuery size dependency issue and realized if all I was needing Javascript was for adding, removing, and toggling classes, then why would I resort to use such a unnecessary dependency just to make things interactive? Why not write the extra code to trigger something after all these were how adding a class looked for jQuery and vanilla Javascript.</p>\n<p>Assuming you had a nav stored as a variable with both:</p>\n<p>jQuery</p>\n<pre><code>$nav.addClass( \'color--red\' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>javascript</p>\n<pre><code>nav.classList.add(\'color--red\');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Yup. It was that easy. But at the time, a StackOverflow made me worry about support and I resorted to use small pre-written functions for this project. </p>\n<h2>It was a text-based game</h2>\n<p>The core-idea of this project was to create a text-based game with ambient visuals. As the end goal was for something to be displayed on a phone, I realized screen real-estate should be devoted to the text and any visuals should be second in nature to a user.</p>\n<img src="/545932a857c16d50c705390086e31740.gif" alt="Example Prompt" style="width: 50%" width="329" height="541">\n<p>My primary goal was to learn more about Javascript. Secondary, was to create a somewhat coherent story, which I did, but in an “episode” format.  So in reality, the game feels short, but it is as most “episode” like games tend to be.</p>\n<p>One of the difficulties was figuring out the best way of storing game data. I wanted to at the time explore using JSON files, but I honestly just didn’t get Javascript that much at the time to do this, and in the end, I just stored the game text/options in the same <code>.JS</code> file.</p>\n<img src="/d149198da05635814a5096f38857c235.gif" alt="Game Intro" style="width: 50%" width="331" height="539">\n<p>Looking back, there’s a ton of things that I could have done better, but that’s the ongoing issue with development:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There’s always something that can be done better, but do you have the time or knowledge to make it better?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My issue was mainly the latter, knowledge. Because of this, my plan is to add to this project with the knowledge I have now of better patterns within Javascript.</p>\n<h2>Struggles</h2>\n<p>Two struggles were precedent throughout the project.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Learning Javascript.</li>\n<li>Writing a decent story and mapping out choice logic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some screenshots of the latter:</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 58.90736342042756%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Mind-Node - plotting game option logic"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-90c66.png"\n        srcset="/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-00ad5.png 200w,\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-da9b7.png 400w,\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-90c66.png 800w,\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-cd79c.png 842w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 53.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA/UlEQVQoz6WSzW6DMBCE8/4P1ktvOfTSJiUJNgbW9tpL0uPUPyKqSlBRcxh5BcvH7ox3+uigG0oawU4wfU1PaTcXbAXqQBgN31+aQ0Cv3OrHQQLiNT4GznKmTimTwA8CuQlsJ2UL9TmWuj97tG8OH68G1DM4BpAnWLbrQE+C4AXUVujvPrlK6c2yP84lsE+rJz9Pe4vmJTXpBNWxTEc6WXBmdCdKsmCO6x4uwEOdLgOz8srmQttDWRjOFZTPf6X80KOhQh17+OifA84BRamG52u12MKnq9USOMRtQPXuUhgDhpZLUKVWDFKxhEKX+sO8zSbgX8p2dI2Fo3B/9g2QDUnVRRaX6AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Mind-Node - plotting story logic"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-90c66.png"\n        srcset="/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-00ad5.png 200w,\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-da9b7.png 400w,\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-90c66.png 800w,\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-7da25.png 1100w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<h2>Here’s a little sneak peak</h2>\n<p>Below <span role="img" aria-label="point down"></span>👇🏾 is a preview of a little redesign of the project that I’m working through.
