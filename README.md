# Ben Modayil's personal site 👨‍💻

Hey there, this is my personal site for blogging/possible employers to look up.

It's a static site generated using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and React.

Currently, my blogging setup uses markdown. I'm in the process of switching over the reins to Contentful or similar for pulling in data for the site.

It uses serves a different post template depending on the `type` of post it reads in the post's frontmatter.

I'll be linking up a personal case study for the site here soon.
