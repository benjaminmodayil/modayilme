## Hey there!

I'm Benjamin Modayil, a front-end developer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Currently, I'm fun-employed. Looking for new opportunities, but also just taking time to reflect on the past four years of college at Cedarville University and the last four months with Viget for what started as an internship then turned apprenticeship.

On my site, you'll find blog posts about things I'm learning, things I'm pursuing, and things I'm thinking.

If you're a possible employer, feel free to check out some of my work posts on my [home page](/) and [HMU](/contact) ("hit me up", slang for "contact me" as all these cool millenials say). But if using b-boy slang like "HMU" rubs you the wrong way, then we're probably not a match (albeit, I know how to handle myself circumstantially).

I'll write some about my experience in the coming weeks, but for now... HEY! Welcome to the new site.
