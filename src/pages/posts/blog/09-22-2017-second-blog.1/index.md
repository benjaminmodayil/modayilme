Creating todos are my jam and most likely they are yours too. For a whole lot of us there is a joyous feeling of being organized and having things todo. But simply, we hate actually doing them.

Unless those todos relate themselves to a passion, they will most likely not get done on time… or ever.

I always tell myself that finding the right todo list will actually make me productive. That it will make me want to get stuff done.

I’ve actually bought and downloaded multiple types of todo list applications over the last few years. None of them changed me, and in turn, I’ve given up on todo lists that were designed to be used in a certain way.

> I’m tired of using a todo list as an excuse to not getting things done.

I think we need to stop treating a todo list as a life changing object. Todo lists won’t change our desire to be productive. Only practicing being productive will make us productive.  

For me, I’ll just stick to Excel.
