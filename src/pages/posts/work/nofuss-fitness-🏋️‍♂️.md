## What is it?

NoFuss is an application where you can track your meals, exercises, and weight progress.

After you signup and answer a few questions, you'll be able start logging data.

Once you've logged weight over the course of a month, you'll start to see graphs showing your trend of weight gain/loss.

NoFuss uses a combination many tools including:

- Node
- Express
- Mongo
- PostCSS
- TailwindCSS
- Webpack
- JWTs
- PUG templating
- and more!

It also features user-protected endpoints if you need your data for some reason.

## Design
NoFuss was designed by me using Sketch on Mac. 

Here are some screenshots of the different views in the application:
