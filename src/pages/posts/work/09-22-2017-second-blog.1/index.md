I wish the tl;dr above was created by me, but it was created by our amazing copywriter [Elyse](http://www.google.com). 

It was an ongoing joke for the project. At Viget, interns aren't expected to fetch coffee, or do miscellaneous tasks, we are there to learn and create something cool.

The purpose of this post is to convey things that I've learned about Front-End Development and things I struggled learning.

- working with another Front-End Developer 
  - initial thoughts
    - scared
  - after thoughts
- SVG
  - Issues
    - Weird transformations in certain browsers
    - Issues where the tool for compresssion would change the colors of the initial design
  - Learned
    - Better to export and minimize by hand
    - don't let your compressor clean the IDs of the layer names in your SVG, this will cause issues with other SVG's using those same ID names.
- Git Gud
  - We all had issues working with developers on the same project

- General
  - Codepen is amazing at quickly prototyping projects
