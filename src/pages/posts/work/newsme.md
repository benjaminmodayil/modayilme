## The Idea

The idea came from looking for an interesting project to create using some sort of API. After coming across NewsAPI and realizing that it hasn't been used as much as other APIs, I decided to take a stab at creating something small with it.

Newsme lets you search for news, apply a category, set a date range, and even save articles locally to the browser's memory. After applying one of those inputs, just watch the news articles flow in. The purpose of the project is to help users stay informed about the news, not from one source, but a multitude.

You can also save an article to localstorage for future reading. It's built using the Fetch API, SCSS, CSS Grid, and a multitude of transformations via Gulp's pipeline. The basic layout was designed with Sketch.
