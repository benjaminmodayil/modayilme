So in reality, the game feels short, but it is as most ‚Äúepisode‚Äù like games tend to be.</p>\\n<p>One of the difficulties was figuring out the best way of storing game data. I wanted to at the time explore using JSON files, but I honestly just didn‚Äôt get Javascript that much at the time to do this, and in the end, I just stored the game text/options in the same <code>.JS</code> file.</p>\\n<img src=\\\"/d149198da05635814a5096f38857c235.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Game Intro\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%\\\" width=\\\"331\\\" height=\\\"539\\\">\\n<p>Looking back, there‚Äôs a ton of things that I could have done better, but that‚Äôs the ongoing issue with development:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>There‚Äôs always something that can be done better, but do you have the time or knowledge to make it better?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>My issue was mainly the latter, knowledge. Because of this, my plan is to add to this project with the knowledge I have now of better patterns within Javascript.</p>\\n<h2>Struggles</h2>\\n<p>Two struggles were precedent throughout the project.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Learning Javascript.</li>\\n<li>Writing a decent story and mapping out choice logic.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Here are some screenshots of the latter:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 58.90736342042756%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Mind-Node - plotting game option logic\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-90c66.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-00ad5.png 200w,\\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-da9b7.png 400w,\\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-90c66.png 800w,\\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-cd79c.png 842w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 53.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA/UlEQVQoz6WSzW6DMBCE8/4P1ktvOfTSJiUJNgbW9tpL0uPUPyKqSlBRcxh5BcvH7ox3+uigG0oawU4wfU1PaTcXbAXqQBgN31+aQ0Cv3OrHQQLiNT4GznKmTimTwA8CuQlsJ2UL9TmWuj97tG8OH68G1DM4BpAnWLbrQE+C4AXUVujvPrlK6c2yP84lsE+rJz9Pe4vmJTXpBNWxTEc6WXBmdCdKsmCO6x4uwEOdLgOz8srmQttDWRjOFZTPf6X80KOhQh17+OifA84BRamG52u12MKnq9USOMRtQPXuUhgDhpZLUKVWDFKxhEKX+sO8zSbgX8p2dI2Fo3B/9g2QDUnVRRaX6AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Mind-Node - plotting story logic\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-90c66.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-00ad5.png 200w,\\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-da9b7.png 400w,\\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-90c66.png 800w,\\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-7da25.png 1100w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h2>Here‚Äôs a little sneak peak</h2>\\n<p>Below <span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"point down\\\"></span>üëáüèæ is a preview of a little redesign of the project that I‚Äôm working through.
