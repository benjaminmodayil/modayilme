Growing up, Iâ€™ve never felt the desire to be in front. I liked the background. There were moments that I would daydream of saying things I wanted to say, but by the time I would try to say them, those moments were already gone.

If youâ€™ve seen the Secret Life of Walter Mitty, maybe youâ€™ve realized your resemblance to the character, always daydreaming and never living life. Iâ€™ve always had that movie in the back of my head and now I feel the need to do something about it.

## The Web

Iâ€™m not a brilliant writer. I somewhat detest it, but I do realize the beauty of a blog medium on the web. The medium encapsulates a moment of time in the authorâ€™s life. Generally, the author writes something going on in their lives, whether it be awesome, interesting, moving, or sad.

A lot of those words describes a flurry of emotions I feel on a daily basis. Most of the time I come to a certain realization or lesson which I soon forget. What if I didnâ€™t forget ever lesson? I like the idea of a never forgetting blog. The Internet canâ€™t as easily forget. Itâ€™s documented and in a way, permanent.

I think itâ€™s time for me to stop daydreaming, stop the machine of learning, but then forgetting. I want to be better. We all want to be better. Encapsulation is one of the first steps for me to become better.

> I can only become better if I remember where I was the day before.

I hope that my encapsulations amuse, interest, and even confuse you. Perhaps, we all can get better by learning together.
