## Gaming/Streaming

- Desktop PC
- I use this [XLR to USB](https://amzn.to/3mQQ6zd) adapter to have my mic audio split to my gaming PC since my primary mic + mixer is connected to my streaming PC.
- [Phillips Hue Go](https://amzn.to/3nVGzZ8) light to create some mood lighting behind my gaming monitor.
- [Skylight projector](https://amzn.to/2KC26HK) adds some ambience to the room while streaming, albeit I can't remotely turn this on using my Google Home + smart outlet combination. I would upgrade in the future to one that can be operated remotely as I'm all in on "smart" products at this point.
- [Asus 27" 1440p 1ms monitor](https://amzn.to/34N1END) 144hz (but up to 165hz overclocked) does not leave me with any complaints, but I will one day upgrade to a 240hz monitor once I confirm FPS performance with a Nvidia RTX3080 graphics card

## Work/Office

- [Edifier Speakers](https://amzn.to/3mLv1pO) are pretty nice. Even has bluetooth, albeit, I don't know how to get that part working.
- [LG 34" QHD IPS curved monitor](https://amzn.to/3mSP5GI) as my main driver. After 2ish years with this monitor, I'm thinking about making it into a secondary monitor as 34"s are too big that I find myself not needing the extra wide real estate and have trouble managing windows sometimes even thought I have a ton of shortcuts to handle that. Quality monitor though!
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com) is my favorite keyboard. It has a "layers" feature that lets you have an infinite of custom functionality. Oh yeah, and it's splits in half so you can put a mouse or a trackpad like me in the middle.
- [Apple Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ2R2LL/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver?afid=p238%7CsoiaTpQ02-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_420261373436_pgrid_46344808516_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-btb--slid---product-) for office work, but I use an actual mouse for gaming on my other computer.
