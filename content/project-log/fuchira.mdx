Pre-announcing Fuchira (pronounced fooCHEERuh). The name is definitely subject to change, but this is going to be my own personal project for the upcoming months and probably next few years.

The basic idea behind Fuchira is to create an **open-sourced** alternative to project management tools like JIRA, Monday, Asana, and etc. The goal is to create a free _host it yourself_ version of services learning from their best qualities and fixing issues that one might have with each.

One of the main issues that I have with most project management software is that there is a system of politics around how "Agile" and how JIRA might work at a specific company. For example, I've worked at places where where you were responsible for creating your own stories and managing your own board for projects for your work. This was cool, but managing your sprint and upcoming sprints backlog of items as well as using the correct types of fields can be a lot of work for just one developer when you need to **actually do work**. I've also worked at other places where project managers disaprove of you adding stories, have rules about certain how certain issues have to be in the current program increment "epics", want points/work estimates on stories before you start, and etc. Personally, I think the problem is due to how flexible JIRA is. While most would think flexibility is a feature of JIRA, I would say it's its curse, since it allows anyone to add their own rules on top of it.


<!-- In my opinion, the more decisions you give a user, the time to decision factor increases exponentially. It  that many organizations practice their flavor of project management. Even those that practice "Agile" have their flavors like "Safe Agile" and even though that flavor of "Safe Agile" might be a common practice for different organizations, each company and then team deviate along the path when it comes to their own planning and practice. -->

On the flipside, very opinionated software could suck pretty hard if its "opinions" aren't good. This is the risk, but it also allows the tool to establish a particular process and guide a user through that process if the software is "less flexible" and provides one or two ways forward. If I'm able to create a decent open-sourced project management tool, then the rewards would be very high to the point that project managers + JIRA politics/self opinions could be eliminated out of the process entirely and anyone could make sense of project status at a given time. 

I've come across two things. One, that the more decisions you give a user, the time to decision increases exponentially. Two, many organizations practice their flavor of project management. Even those that practice "Agile" have their flavors like "Safe Agile" and even though that flavor of "Safe Agile" might be a common practice for different organizations, each company and then team deviate along the path when it comes to their own planning and practice.
