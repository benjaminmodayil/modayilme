description: 'Open-sourced Project Management Tools'
---

Pre-announcing Fuchira (pronounced fooCHEERuh). Name is definitely subject to change, but this is going to be my own personal project for the upcoming years or so.

The basic idea behind Fuchira is to create an open-sourced alternative to project management tools like JIRA, Monday.com, Asana, and etc. Hopefully, fixing issues that one might have with each type of tool and stripping away project management and "Agile" politics from the board.

I'm not planning on making Fuchira as flexible as possible. Instead, it's goal is to be extremely opinonated software. I've come across two things. One, that the more decisions you give a user, the time to decision increases exponentially. Two, many organizations practice their flavor of project management. Even those that practice "Agile" have their flavors like "Safe Agile" and even though that flavor of "Safe Agile" might be a common practice for different organizations, each company and then team deviate along the path when it comes to their own planning and practice.

Yeet!
