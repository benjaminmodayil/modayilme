I liked the background. There were moments that I would daydream of saying things I wanted to say, but by the time I would try to say them, those moments were already gone.</p>\n<p>If you’ve seen the Secret Life of Walter Mitty, maybe you’ve realized your resemblance to the character, always daydreaming and never living life. I’ve always had that movie in the back of my head and now I feel the need to do something about it.</p>\n<h2>The Web</h2>\n<p>I’m not a brilliant writer. I somewhat detest it, but I do realize the beauty of a blog medium on the web. The medium encapsulates a moment of time in the author’s life. Generally, the author writes something going on in their lives, whether it be awesome, interesting, moving, or sad.   </p>\n<p>A lot of those words describes a flurry of emotions I feel on a daily basis. Most of the time I come to a certain realization or lesson which I soon forget. What if I didn’t forget ever lesson? I like the idea of a never forgetting blog. The Internet can’t as easily forget. It’s documented and in a way, permanent.</p>\n<p>I think it’s time for me to stop daydreaming, stop the machine of learning, but then forgetting. I want to be better. We all want to be better. Encapsulation is one of the first steps for me to become better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can only become better if I remember where I was the day before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that my encapsulations amuse, interest, and even confuse you. Perhaps, we all can get better by learning together.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"01 September, 2016",title:"Finding your voice 🎤",tldr:"Ben starts a diary",path:"/blog/finding-your-voice"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog/finding-your-voice",prev:null,next:{html:'<h2>Hey there!</h2>\n<p>I’m Benjamin Modayil, a front-end developer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
