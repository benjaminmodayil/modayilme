On top of it all, we were a team spread over three locations fighting to stay on the same page and to progress forward.</p>\\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\\n<p>Working with a variety of people tends to be a problem when lines aren‚Äôt drawn. When you have a specific role, in my case FED. It‚Äôs clear that you don‚Äôt necessarily have a role in the product direction, but are the one helping build the product.</p>\\n<p>Problem was that each intern, while having specific UX, DESIGN, COPY, FED, and DEV roles, had a say in what we wanted to make.  While it was awesome to have that power, it was hard to collaborate when each intern wanted to take our Coffee website in different directions.</p>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to use an aeropress!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to make fancy coffee drinks!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n<strong>We should teach people how to make good coffee with the tools they already have.</strong>\\n</q>\\n<p>In the end, we each learned to show a little compromise and rally around our unifying idea, <strong>coffee</strong>.</p>\\n<h4>Two FEDs?!</h4>\\n<p>An aspect of this collaboration issue was that there were two front-end developers for the intern class.</p>\\n<p>Initially, my worry was that there would be problems of workload and someone else would be getting to code the part of the website that the other wanted to. This didn‚Äôt end up being the case. The other Front-End developer, Cyron, was great to work with. We had great back and forths that made the project smooth to work on.</p>\\n<p>Time did end up becoming an issue, as our designer had a family reunion in a another timezone that couldn‚Äôt be avoided in the middle of her design phase, but despite this, she still worked hard in providing us the comps that we needed.</p>\\n<h4>Git Gud</h4>\\n<p>There was an aspect of Git that I never really tackled before. I knew how to setup a project, commit, push, and pull, but soon realized I didn‚Äôt know much about Git in the context of a team.</p>\\n<p>It all came down to one command that at least two of the three total developers didn‚Äôt use as much <code>git rebase [branch]</code>.</p>\\n<p>We ran into issues early on where rebasing became a long overdrawn process and we would have two or three people on a call just going through all the merge conflicts created in the process. </p>\\n<p>Eventually, we all got on the same page with <code>git</code> usage in the project and things started to go smoothly üëåüèæ.</p>\\n<h3>SVG</h3>\\n<p>Our biggest time-consumer for the FED build cycle were working with SVGs.</p>\\n<p>The first issue was getting everyone on the same page about SVGs. At the start of the project, we knew we wanted to use them for animation as we originally intended the site to be performant, but there was a FED/Designer divide on how to go about these SVGs. Common issues with SVG handoffs seems to deal with how many node-points a path has, layer naming, flattening of paths, and random things in between. Plus when you‚Äôre going to be animating something, there is a need for the SVG file to be accounting for any animation.</p>\\n<p>With that was the issue of SVG programs. The original vectors were created with Illustrator CC, but to work with the files, the FEDs were limited to Figma. I even took them from Illustrator and brought them into Sketch. This created huge problems as we didn‚Äôt know about it at the time, each program handled SVG exports slightly differently.</p>\\n<p><em>Here‚Äôs a good podcast from <a href=\\\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/270-svg-sketch-peter-nowell/\\\">Shoptalk</a> that discusses this a little bit.</em></p>\\n<p>Among our issues, when it came time to finally get our animations working, they had issues rendering in specific browsers. Chrome for example would render out one of our SVGs into looking like it exploded into sharp shards while Safari rendered normally. In the end, we removed the unreliable SVGs and kept the ones the worked well due to the time we had left.</p>\\n<p>The whole experience of working with SVGs on this project sure makes me want to reread Chris Coyier‚Äôs book <a href=\\\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\\\">Practical SVG</a>.</p>\\n<p>This also made me realize that it‚Äôs best to minimize SVGs by hand. Well, after getting a decent export. In Illustrator/Sketch/Figma/whatever, there are tons of different ways of compressing your SVG, whether that‚Äôs combining paths, flattening paths/layers, or just removing unnecessary things like that raster <code>.jpg</code> pattern a designer included in without realizing that would ruin the idea of a scalable vector‚Ä¶</p>\\n<p>From there there are great tools that can take things further like <a href=\\\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\\\">SVGOMG - SVGO‚Äôs Missing GUI</a>, but perhaps we were too liberal with trust in the compressor for handling our SVGs. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be exporting by hand. SVG compressors tend to copy similar elements and use <code>link</code> to be frugal with space. The problem with this is that a good number of times we couldn‚Äôt debug in the browser because the usage of <code>link</code>  would place us into the <strong><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\\\">shadow DOM</a></strong>. <em>Insert Stranger things music</em></p>\\n<h2>Personal Pride</h2>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float \\\">\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__text\\\">\\n<p>My favorite portion of the website was figuring out the <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">Machines</a> portion of the site. What made this page interesting was that it was a pretty interactive page with tons of tabs. When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n</span>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__asset\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List Example\\\" width=\\\"439\\\" height=\\\"377\\\">\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It‚Äôs nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-90c66.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-00ad5.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-da9b7.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-90c66.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-1f2ba.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>ARIA</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you‚Äôll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You‚Äôll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all. So only if someone needed to navigate the website with their keyboard would any tab outlines show. This was done using Viget‚Äôs <a href=\\\"https://ten1seven.github.io/what-input/\\\">WhatInput</a> which allows you to style/create interactions based on the mouse, keyboard, or touch events.</p>\\n<h2>Summary</h2>\\n<p>I‚Äôll probably re-edit this page and provide more examples as I see fit, but here‚Äôs a summary of the things FEDs had to tackle in this project:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Collaboration, especially with <code>git</code></li>\\n<li>SVG animations and debugging those animations.</li>\\n<li>How to make an interactive site accessible.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/137a832215cf994a5fde170d9fe04543.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<p>Some other things I‚Äôll just touch on shortly were two things:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://codepen.io/\\\">Codepen</a> as a tool to quickly prototype ideas and animations.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://getbem.com/naming/\\\">BEM ‚Äî Block Element Modifier</a> as a method of making our classes more understandable to anyone else working with the project.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for other writings about the execution of this project check out the <a href=\\\"https://www.viget.com/articles/world-meet-ground-rules\\\">introduction of GroundRules</a> by Elyse or a <a href=\\\"http://vivianzwang.com/ground-rules\\\">design case study</a> by Vivian.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Ground Rules  <span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">‚òï</span> \",\"headerColor\":\"#2D4DAF\",\"date\":\"August 11, 2017\",\"description\":\"Ground Rules is a site built by the Viget Interns of 2017.

I‚Äôve been going through a few personal challenges and I‚Äôll be making the effort to not let circumstance define actuality for this new year.</p>\\n<h2>Resolutions</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Better physical health.</strong> </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I‚Äôve realized my triggers for eating are based around television and I‚Äôm hoping to avoid an extreme of both. Ideally, replacing lounging and watching television with exercise and podcasts.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li><strong>Focus on my mental health.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Something that has been a thorn in my side for the longest time is my mental health. I‚Äôve always been paranoid about others‚Äô opinions and, not related to the former, I‚Äôve tend to have long periods of sadness. It got to a crippling point this past summer where I found myself in tears most nights.</p>\\n<p>Part of me thinks it was because I was missing out on some key communities due to me being in another state for 4 to 5 months. My friend Don explained the idea of key communities to me best. He talked how people tend to have three communities: 1. Family, 2. Work, and 3. Just another outlet (paraphrasing really hard right now). During the summer, I had only a work community and found myself struggling to fill in the gaps. I tried by attending meet ups and different churches, but it was impossible to build a sense of community when you knew you were only there short-term.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li><strong>Get back in the Word.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p> I‚Äôve had a hard time in my relationship with God and listening to Him in any capacity.  As I‚Äôve gotten more ‚Äúsad‚Äù, I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs when I‚Äôve moved farther away from God.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\\n<li><strong>Find honest friends.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>One of my most hated pet peeves is small talk. I‚Äôll do it, but I just hate people being so indirect, and full of false appearances.</p>\\n<p>Something that I want to learn how to communicate is an honest ‚Äúhow are you doing?‚Äù with the effect of getting genuine answers. But then again, I have the terrible tendency of saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going‚Äù to that question myself.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li><strong>Become a full-stack developer.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p> Coming back to Philadelphia after my apprenticeship was nerve-racking. Looking for jobs is not fun. And while I was only looking for jobs for a month and a half, I‚Äôve noticed something during my search. While I do love CMS work and hope to work in a digital agency with CMS work, there‚Äôs a stronger need for job applicants within the Philly area of the ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù mindset.</p>\\n<p> Whenever I‚Äôd be looking for jobs as a Front-end Developer, I would tend to find jobs in Philly for FEDs with full-stack qualifications. Yes, that does sound backwards, but tend to be the noticeable job market here. If I really wanted to find a job with my current qualifications, it seemed I would have to move out of state. But with #2 of this resolution list, I intend to stay within Philly as it‚Äôs where I know people. </p>\\n<p> Currently, I‚Äôm working on this through a personal lesson plan, plus part-time enrollment in a full-stack Javascript bootcamp program. The great thing is that I only pay for the months it takes me to graduate and I‚Äôm on course with graduation in 3-4 months versus the full six as I‚Äôm already well-versed in the fundamentals.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"6\\\">\\n<li><strong>Get my freaking license.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p> It‚Äôs been almost six years since I originally could have gotten it. Fear has gotten in my way before, but I‚Äôm finally ready to get behind the driver‚Äôs seat.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"7\\\">\\n<li><strong>Find a ‚Äúno-screen‚Äù hobby.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I need to do something to unwind. Code tends to be too much of my life at the moment. I started reading books again, but I don‚Äôt think that should count. I want to unwind my mind and process less information. Part of me thinks I might try learning how to crochet again.\\n<span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"I dunno\\\"></span>¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"8\\\">\\n<li><strong>Give a tech-talk</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I‚Äôm hoping to give more presentations on random technologies that I‚Äôve been interested in. I started to present more since my internship and apprenticeship this past summer. Hopefully this goal can be met with a local Meetup group.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"9\\\">\\n<li><strong>Bonus goal</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I really want to get into ‚Äúsmart home hacking‚Äù with arduinos and raspberry pis.

When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n</span>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__asset\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List Example\\\" width=\\\"439\\\" height=\\\"377\\\">\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It‚Äôs nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-90c66.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-00ad5.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-da9b7.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-90c66.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-1f2ba.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>ARIA</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you‚Äôll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You‚Äôll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all. So only if someone needed to navigate the website with their keyboard would any tab outlines show. This was done using Viget‚Äôs <a href=\\\"https://ten1seven.github.io/what-input/\\\">WhatInput</a> which allows you to style/create interactions based on the mouse, keyboard, or touch events.</p>\\n<h2>Summary</h2>\\n<p>I‚Äôll probably re-edit this page and provide more examples as I see fit, but here‚Äôs a summary of the things FEDs had to tackle in this project:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Collaboration, especially with <code>git</code></li>\\n<li>SVG animations and debugging those animations.</li>\\n<li>How to make an interactive site accessible.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/137a832215cf994a5fde170d9fe04543.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<p>Some other things I‚Äôll just touch on shortly were two things:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://codepen.io/\\\">Codepen</a> as a tool to quickly prototype ideas and animations.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://getbem.com/naming/\\\">BEM ‚Äî Block Element Modifier</a> as a method of making our classes more understandable to anyone else working with the project.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for other writings about the execution of this project check out the <a href=\\\"https://www.viget.com/articles/world-meet-ground-rules\\\">introduction of GroundRules</a> by Elyse or a <a href=\\\"http://vivianzwang.com/ground-rules\\\">design case study</a> by Vivian.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Ground Rules  <span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">‚òï</span> \",\"headerColor\":\"#2D4DAF\",\"date\":\"August 11, 2017\",\"description\":\"Ground Rules is a site built by the Viget Interns of 2017.

I‚Äôve been going through a few personal challenges and I‚Äôll be making the effort to not let circumstance define actuality for this new year.</p>\\n<h2>Resolutions</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Better physical health.</strong> </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I‚Äôve realized my triggers for eating are based around television and I‚Äôm hoping to avoid an extreme of both. Ideally, replacing lounging and watching television with exercise and podcasts.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\\n<li><strong>Focus on my mental health.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Something that has been a thorn in my side for the longest time is my mental health. I‚Äôve always been paranoid about others‚Äô opinions and, not related to the former, I‚Äôve tend to have long periods of sadness. It got to a crippling point this past summer where I found myself in tears most nights.</p>\\n<p>Part of me thinks it was because I was missing out on some key communities due to me being in another state for 4 to 5 months. My friend Don explained the idea of key communities to me best. He talked how people tend to have three communities: 1. Family, 2. Work, and 3. Just another outlet (paraphrasing really hard right now). During the summer, I had only a work community and found myself struggling to fill in the gaps. I tried by attending meet ups and different churches, but it was impossible to build a sense of community when you knew you were only there short-term.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li><strong>Get back in the Word.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p> I‚Äôve had a hard time in my relationship with God and listening to Him in any capacity.  As I‚Äôve gotten more ‚Äúsad‚Äù, I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs when I‚Äôve moved farther away from God.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\\n<li><strong>Find honest friends.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>One of my most hated pet peeves is small talk. I‚Äôll do it, but I just hate people being so indirect, and full of false appearances.</p>\\n<p>Something that I want to learn how to communicate is an honest ‚Äúhow are you doing?‚Äù with the effect of getting genuine answers. But then again, I have the terrible tendency of saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going‚Äù to that question myself.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li><strong>Become a full-stack developer.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p> Coming back to Philadelphia after my apprenticeship was nerve-racking. Looking for jobs is not fun. And while I was only looking for jobs for a month and a half, I‚Äôve noticed something during my search. While I do love CMS work and hope to work in a digital agency with CMS work, there‚Äôs a stronger need for job applicants within the Philly area of the ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù mindset.</p>\\n<p> Whenever I‚Äôd be looking for jobs as a Front-end Developer, I would tend to find jobs in Philly for FEDs with full-stack qualifications. Yes, that does sound backwards, but tend to be the noticeable job market here. If I really wanted to find a job with my current qualifications, it seemed I would have to move out of state. But with #2 of this resolution list, I intend to stay within Philly as it‚Äôs where I know people. </p>\\n<p> Currently, I‚Äôm working on this through a personal lesson plan, plus part-time enrollment in a full-stack Javascript bootcamp program. The great thing is that I only pay for the months it takes me to graduate and I‚Äôm on course with graduation in 3-4 months versus the full six as I‚Äôm already well-versed in the fundamentals.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"6\\\">\\n<li><strong>Get my freaking license.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p> It‚Äôs been almost six years since I originally could have gotten it. Fear has gotten in my way before, but I‚Äôm finally ready to get behind the driver‚Äôs seat.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"7\\\">\\n<li><strong>Find a ‚Äúno-screen‚Äù hobby.</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I need to do something to unwind. Code tends to be too much of my life at the moment. I started reading books again, but I don‚Äôt think that should count. I want to unwind my mind and process less information. Part of me thinks I might try learning how to crochet again.\\n<span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"I dunno\\\"></span>¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"8\\\">\\n<li><strong>Give a tech-talk</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I‚Äôm hoping to give more presentations on random technologies that I‚Äôve been interested in. I started to present more since my internship and apprenticeship this past summer. Hopefully this goal can be met with a local Meetup group.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"9\\\">\\n<li><strong>Bonus goal</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>I really want to get into ‚Äúsmart home hacking‚Äù with arduinos and raspberry pis. Seems like a great side hobby, but the only problem is that it breaks the ‚Äúno-screen‚Äù rule of number 7. </p>\\n<p>Feel free to slide into my DMs on Twitter or on my site‚Äôs <a href=\\\"/contact\\\">contact form</a>.
