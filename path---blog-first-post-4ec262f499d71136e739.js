Currently, I‚Äôm fun-employed. Looking for new opportunities, but also just taking time to reflect on the past four years of college at Cedarville University and the last four months with Viget for what started as an internship then turned apprenticeship.</p>\n<p>On my site, you‚Äôll find blog posts about things I‚Äôm learning, things I‚Äôm pursuing, and things I‚Äôm thinking.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a possible employer, feel free to check out some of my work posts on my <a href="/">home page</a> and <a href="/contact">HMU</a> (‚Äúhit me up‚Äù, slang for ‚Äúcontact me‚Äù as all these cool millenials say). But if using b-boy slang like ‚ÄúHMU‚Äù rubs you the wrong way, then we‚Äôre probably not a match (albeit, I know how to handle myself circumstantially).</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll write some about my experience in the coming weeks, but for now‚Ä¶ HEY!

I liked the background. There were moments that I would daydream of saying things I wanted to say, but by the time I would try to say them, those moments were already gone.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôve seen the Secret Life of Walter Mitty, maybe you‚Äôve realized your resemblance to the character, always daydreaming and never living life. I‚Äôve always had that movie in the back of my head and now I feel the need to do something about it.</p>\n<h2>The Web</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôm not a brilliant writer. I somewhat detest it, but I do realize the beauty of a blog medium on the web. The medium encapsulates a moment of time in the author‚Äôs life. Generally, the author writes something going on in their lives, whether it be awesome, interesting, moving, or sad.   </p>\n<p>A lot of those words describes a flurry of emotions I feel on a daily basis. Most of the time I come to a certain realization or lesson which I soon forget. What if I didn‚Äôt forget ever lesson? I like the idea of a never forgetting blog. The Internet can‚Äôt as easily forget. It‚Äôs documented and in a way, permanent.</p>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs time for me to stop daydreaming, stop the machine of learning, but then forgetting. I want to be better. We all want to be better. Encapsulation is one of the first steps for me to become better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can only become better if I remember where I was the day before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that my encapsulations amuse, interest, and even confuse you. Perhaps, we all can get better by learning together.</p>",id:"/Users/benjaminmodayil/Documents/sites/modayilme_gatsby/src/pages/posts/blog/09-21-2017-finding-your-voice/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{layout:"blog",title:'Finding your voice  <span role="img" aria-label="" alt="">üé§</span> ',tldr:"Ben starts a diary",path:"/blog/finding-your-voice",type:"blog",external:null}},next:{html:'<p>Creating todos are one of my favorite things todo and most likely they are yours as well. For a whole lot of us there is a joyous feeling of being organized and having things that make us feel busy. But simply, we hate actually doing them.</p>\n<p>Unless those todos relate themselves to a passion, they will most likely not get done on time‚Ä¶ or ever. The worst part about it all is that when we see long lists of todo items we get overwhelmed and slightly depressed when we don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt actually completing anything.</p>\n<p>I always tell myself that finding the right todo application will actually make me productive. That it will make me want to get stuff done.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve actually bought and downloaded multiple types of todo list applications over the last few years. None of them changed me, and in turn, I‚Äôve given up on general todo lists that were designed to be used in a particular way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm tired of using a todo list as an excuse to not getting things done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we need to stop treating a todo list as a life changing object.

Only practicing being productive will make us productive.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 45.51820728291317%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Excel for ToDos"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/59db0ca8a4ff736fcadac9d57ce78cdf-90c66.png"\n        srcset="/static/59db0ca8a4ff736fcadac9d57ce78cdf-00ad5.png 200w,\n/static/59db0ca8a4ff736fcadac9d57ce78cdf-da9b7.png 400w,\n/static/59db0ca8a4ff736fcadac9d57ce78cdf-90c66.png 800w,\n/static/59db0ca8a4ff736fcadac9d57ce78cdf-f7205.png 1200w,\n/static/59db0ca8a4ff736fcadac9d57ce78cdf-9a3fd.png 1428w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>At the moment, I‚Äôm trying to not let a application define my mood.
