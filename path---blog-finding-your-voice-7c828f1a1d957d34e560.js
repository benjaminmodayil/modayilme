I somewhat detest it, but I do realize the beauty of a blog medium on the web. The medium encapsulates a moment of time in the author’s life. Generally, the author writes something going on in their lives, whether it be awesome, interesting, moving, or sad.   </p>\n<p>A lot of those words describes a flurry of emotions I feel on a daily basis. Most of the time I come to a certain realization or lesson which I soon forget. What if I didn’t forget ever lesson? I like the idea of a never forgetting blog. The Internet can’t as easily forget. It’s documented and in a way, permanent.</p>\n<p>I think it’s time for me to stop daydreaming, stop the machine of learning, but then forgetting. I want to be better. We all want to be better. Encapsulation is one of the first steps for me to become better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can only become better if I remember where I was the day before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that my encapsulations amuse, interest, and even confuse you. Perhaps, we all can get better by learning together.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Finding your voice",tldr:"Ben starts a diary",path:"/blog/finding-your-voice"}}},pathContext:{path:"/blog/finding-your-voice",_PARENT:"SOURCE"}}}});
