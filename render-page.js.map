I somewhat detest it, but I do realize the beauty of a blog medium on the web. The medium encapsulates a moment of time in the author’s life. Generally, the author writes something going on in their lives, whether it be awesome, interesting, moving, or sad.   </p>\\n<p>A lot of those words describes a flurry of emotions I feel on a daily basis. Most of the time I come to a certain realization or lesson which I soon forget. What if I didn’t forget ever lesson? I like the idea of a never forgetting blog. The Internet can’t as easily forget. It’s documented and in a way, permanent.</p>\\n<p>I think it’s time for me to stop daydreaming, stop the machine of learning, but then forgetting. I want to be better. We all want to be better. Encapsulation is one of the first steps for me to become better.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I can only become better if I remember where I was the day before.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I hope that my encapsulations amuse, interest, and even confuse you.

For those of you that don’t know, Balsamiq Mockups is for making… mockups, but very low-fidelity versions. In fact, I would argue that they are just wireframes at their core.</p>\\n<p>That was when I was just learning how to make websites in my first web design class. Thank God, my teacher encouraged me to hold off on designing a portfolio site early on and point me into a more capable program for high-fidelity designs.</p>\\n<p><em>Sadly, I do not have the old comps from Balsamiq to display. Just know that they looked like poor sketches with bright colors.</em></p>\\n<p>Later on in my junior year, I went through marathon periods of trying to design and code a portfolio for myself and I would never settle on a design.</p>\\n<p>The impossible thing of it all is the acknowledgement that we don’t know how to design for ourselves.

I’m missing a couple of designs from when I used to work on Photoshop, so this is the next I can show. I wanted to see how might my site might look with a lighter color scheme.\\nI’m a pretty effeminate/unmanly man so I thought having a touch of pinkish tones wouldn’t be too bad, albeit color contrast was very problematic, plus a significant amount of other issues.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>I loved this color scheme. My top three favorite colors are black, dark navy blue, and toned red. So this covered part of those and stuck enough with me to an actual live site version.</p>\\n<p>This was actually the last version of my site to be live. I had a slow transition into my internship that I wasn’t able to give it enough love as I originally intended, so I took my site down until I could.</p>\\n<p>I never really did get to showing that rendition more love.

The only issue with this one is that it got really complicated very fast. Like some of the past designs I had a “Labs” page and a “Work” page. The purpose of the “Labs” page was to showcase <em>experiments</em> and the work page to display actual <em>work</em> that I wanted people to judge me on. This became very messy that it pushed me to try to simplify these pages into one, but I didn’t actually get to do that until my final design (no it’s not the next one)…</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 214.37500000000003%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Site V.5\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-99f60.png 1200w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-22ade.png 1440w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>I went back to my favorite color scheme on this one.

Thank God, my teacher encouraged me to hold off on designing a portfolio site early on and point me into a more capable program for high-fidelity designs.</p>\\n<p><em>Sadly, I do not have the old comps from Balsamiq to display. Just know that they looked like poor sketches with bright colors.</em></p>\\n<p>Later on in my junior year, I went through marathon periods of trying to design and code a portfolio for myself and I would never settle on a design.</p>\\n<p>The impossible thing of it all is the acknowledgement that we don’t know how to design for ourselves. We are our own worst critics. As you can see from the listing of projects below, it is quite noticeable how much I self critique myself and my design capabilities.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 182px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 110.98901098901099%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Listing of the MANY coded sites I've made\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Directory of many portfolio attempts\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/431bb091b730170474eb797574f0621e-626fe.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/431bb091b730170474eb797574f0621e-626fe.png 182w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>Each of those directories either denote a new attempted design direction, or an attempt of a feature change.</p>\\n<p>You might ask why not use <code>.git</code> and <code>github</code> to track these different branches/directions?</p>\\n<p>And I’d have to admit that my experience with <code>.git</code> and <code>github</code> were significantly lacking at the time.

I’ve completed classes for a Web Design minor, but most of my love for the program was directed towards the code-aspect of it.

I wasn’t good at animation, but I was the only one really doing web animation at my school, so it did place me apart from others around me.</p>\\n<p>After a critique from a bunch of my professors, I realized there was a small U.X. issue with the site as the navigation on the left lead to different pages instead of scrolling to the corresponding sections below.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>This actually wasn’t the next design made. I’m missing a couple of designs from when I used to work on Photoshop, so this is the next I can show. I wanted to see how might my site might look with a lighter color scheme.\\nI’m a pretty effeminate/unmanly man so I thought having a touch of pinkish tones wouldn’t be too bad, albeit color contrast was very problematic, plus a significant amount of other issues.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>I loved this color scheme. My top three favorite colors are black, dark navy blue, and toned red. So this covered part of those and stuck enough with me to an actual live site version.</p>\\n<p>This was actually the last version of my site to be live. I had a slow transition into my internship that I wasn’t able to give it enough love as I originally intended, so I took my site down until I could.</p>\\n<p>I never really did get to showing that rendition more love.

The purpose of the “Labs” page was to showcase <em>experiments</em> and the work page to display actual <em>work</em> that I wanted people to judge me on.

Like it’s a pun… and the title of the project.</p>\\n<p>It was an ongoing joke for the project. At Viget, interns aren’t expected to fetch coffee, or do miscellaneous tasks, we were there to learn and create something cool.</p>\\n<p>For this project, I was one of two Front-End Developers on a team of interns with varying roles. On top of the Front-End, we had a copywriter, UX designer, designer, and rails developer.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/8e46de9422495eaabb8b1b1570ee0d00.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\\n<p>We had many lessons learned, but the following highlights a few. On top of it all, we were a team spread over three locations fighting to stay on the same page and to progress forward.</p>\\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\\n<p>Working with a variety of people tends to be a problem when lines aren’t drawn. When you have a specific role, in my case FED. It’s clear that you don’t necessarily have a role in the product direction, but are the one helping build the product.</p>\\n<p>Problem was that each intern, while having specific UX, DESIGN, COPY, FED, and DEV roles, had a say in what we wanted to make.  While it was awesome to have that power, it was hard to collaborate when each intern wanted to take our Coffee website in different directions.</p>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to use an aeropress!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to make fancy coffee drinks!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n<strong>We should teach people how to make good coffee with the tools they already have.</strong>\\n</q>\\n<p>In the end, we each learned to show a little compromise and rally around our unifying idea, <strong>coffee</strong>.</p>\\n<h4>Two FEDs?!</h4>\\n<p>An aspect of this collaboration issue was that there were two front-end developers for the intern class.</p>\\n<p>Initially, my worry was that there would be problems of workload and someone else would be getting to code the part of the website that the other wanted to. This didn’t end up being the case. The other Front-End developer, Cyron, was great to work with. We had great back and forths that made the project smooth to work on.</p>\\n<p>Time did end up becoming an issue, as our designer had a family reunion in a another timezone that couldn’t be avoided in the middle of her design phase, but despite this, she still worked hard in providing us the comps that we needed.</p>\\n<h4>Git Gud</h4>\\n<p>There was an aspect of Git that I never really tackled before. I knew how to setup a project, commit, push, and pull, but soon realized I didn’t know much about Git in the context of a team.</p>\\n<p>It all came down to one command that at least two of the three total developers didn’t use as much <code>git rebase [branch]</code>.</p>\\n<p>We ran into issues early on where rebasing became a long overdrawn process and we would have two or three people on a call just going through all the merge conflicts created in the process. </p>\\n<p>Eventually, we all got on the same page with <code>git</code> usage in the project and things started to go smoothly 👌🏾.</p>\\n<h3>SVG</h3>\\n<p>Our biggest time-consumer for the FED build cycle were working with SVGs.</p>\\n<p>The first issue was getting everyone on the same page about SVGs. At the start of the project, we knew we wanted to use them for animation as we originally intended the site to be performant, but there was a FED/Designer divide on how to go about these SVGs. Common issues with SVG handoffs seems to deal with how many node-points a path has, layer naming, flattening of paths, and random things in between. Plus when you’re going to be animating something, there is a need for the SVG file to be accounting for any animation.</p>\\n<p>With that was the issue of SVG programs. The original vectors were created with Illustrator CC, but to work with the files, the FEDs were limited to Figma. I even took them from Illustrator and brought them into Sketch. This created huge problems as we didn’t know about it at the time, each program handled SVG exports slightly differently.</p>\\n<p><em>Here’s a good podcast from <a href=\\\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/270-svg-sketch-peter-nowell/\\\">Shoptalk</a> that discusses this a little bit.</em></p>\\n<p>Among our issues, when it came time to finally get our animations working, they had issues rendering in specific browsers. Chrome for example would render out one of our SVGs into looking like it exploded into sharp shards while Safari rendered normally. In the end, we removed the unreliable SVGs and kept the ones the worked well due to the time we had left.</p>\\n<p>The whole experience of working with SVGs on this project sure makes me want to reread Chris Coyier’s book <a href=\\\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\\\">Practical SVG</a>.</p>\\n<p>This also made me realize that it’s best to minimize SVGs by hand. Well, after getting a decent export. In Illustrator/Sketch/Figma/whatever, there are tons of different ways of compressing your SVG, whether that’s combining paths, flattening paths/layers, or just removing unnecessary things like that raster <code>.jpg</code> pattern a designer included in without realizing that would ruin the idea of a scalable vector…</p>\\n<p>From there there are great tools that can take things further like <a href=\\\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\\\">SVGOMG - SVGO’s Missing GUI</a>, but perhaps we were too liberal with trust in the compressor for handling our SVGs. Sometimes it’s better to be exporting by hand. SVG compressors tend to copy similar elements and use <code>link</code> to be frugal with space. The problem with this is that a good number of times we couldn’t debug in the browser because the usage of <code>link</code>  would place us into the <strong><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\\\">shadow DOM</a></strong>. <em>Insert Stranger things music</em></p>\\n<h2>Personal Pride</h2>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float \\\">\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__text\\\">\\n<p>My favorite portion of the website was figuring out the <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">Machines</a> portion of the site. What made this page interesting was that it was a pretty interactive page with tons of tabs. When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n</span>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__asset\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List Example\\\" width=\\\"439\\\" height=\\\"377\\\">\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It’s nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-fa181.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>ARIA</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you’ll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You’ll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all.

Like it’s a pun… and the title of the project.</p>\\n<p>It was an ongoing joke for the project. At Viget, interns aren’t expected to fetch coffee, or do miscellaneous tasks, we were there to learn and create something cool.</p>\\n<p>For this project, I was one of two Front-End Developers on a team of interns with varying roles. On top of the Front-End, we had a copywriter, UX designer, designer, and rails developer.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/8e46de9422495eaabb8b1b1570ee0d00.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\\n<p>We had many lessons learned, but the following highlights a few. On top of it all, we were a team spread over three locations fighting to stay on the same page and to progress forward.</p>\\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\\n<p>Working with a variety of people tends to be a problem when lines aren’t drawn. When you have a specific role, in my case FED. It’s clear that you don’t necessarily have a role in the product direction, but are the one helping build the product.</p>\\n<p>Problem was that each intern, while having specific UX, DESIGN, COPY, FED, and DEV roles, had a say in what we wanted to make.  While it was awesome to have that power, it was hard to collaborate when each intern wanted to take our Coffee website in different directions.</p>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to use an aeropress!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to make fancy coffee drinks!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n<strong>We should teach people how to make good coffee with the tools they already have.</strong>\\n</q>\\n<p>In the end, we each learned to show a little compromise and rally around our unifying idea, <strong>coffee</strong>.</p>\\n<h4>Two FEDs?!</h4>\\n<p>An aspect of this collaboration issue was that there were two front-end developers for the intern class.</p>\\n<p>Initially, my worry was that there would be problems of workload and someone else would be getting to code the part of the website that the other wanted to. This didn’t end up being the case. The other Front-End developer, Cyron, was great to work with. We had great back and forths that made the project smooth to work on.</p>\\n<p>Time did end up becoming an issue, as our designer had a family reunion in a another timezone that couldn’t be avoided in the middle of her design phase, but despite this, she still worked hard in providing us the comps that we needed.</p>\\n<h4>Git Gud</h4>\\n<p>There was an aspect of Git that I never really tackled before. I knew how to setup a project, commit, push, and pull, but soon realized I didn’t know much about Git in the context of a team.</p>\\n<p>It all came down to one command that at least two of the three total developers didn’t use as much <code>git rebase [branch]</code>.</p>\\n<p>We ran into issues early on where rebasing became a long overdrawn process and we would have two or three people on a call just going through all the merge conflicts created in the process. </p>\\n<p>Eventually, we all got on the same page with <code>git</code> usage in the project and things started to go smoothly 👌🏾.</p>\\n<h3>SVG</h3>\\n<p>Our biggest time-consumer for the FED build cycle were working with SVGs.</p>\\n<p>The first issue was getting everyone on the same page about SVGs. At the start of the project, we knew we wanted to use them for animation as we originally intended the site to be performant, but there was a FED/Designer divide on how to go about these SVGs. Common issues with SVG handoffs seems to deal with how many node-points a path has, layer naming, flattening of paths, and random things in between. Plus when you’re going to be animating something, there is a need for the SVG file to be accounting for any animation.</p>\\n<p>With that was the issue of SVG programs. The original vectors were created with Illustrator CC, but to work with the files, the FEDs were limited to Figma. I even took them from Illustrator and brought them into Sketch. This created huge problems as we didn’t know about it at the time, each program handled SVG exports slightly differently.</p>\\n<p><em>Here’s a good podcast from <a href=\\\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/270-svg-sketch-peter-nowell/\\\">Shoptalk</a> that discusses this a little bit.</em></p>\\n<p>Among our issues, when it came time to finally get our animations working, they had issues rendering in specific browsers. Chrome for example would render out one of our SVGs into looking like it exploded into sharp shards while Safari rendered normally. In the end, we removed the unreliable SVGs and kept the ones the worked well due to the time we had left.</p>\\n<p>The whole experience of working with SVGs on this project sure makes me want to reread Chris Coyier’s book <a href=\\\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\\\">Practical SVG</a>.</p>\\n<p>This also made me realize that it’s best to minimize SVGs by hand. Well, after getting a decent export. In Illustrator/Sketch/Figma/whatever, there are tons of different ways of compressing your SVG, whether that’s combining paths, flattening paths/layers, or just removing unnecessary things like that raster <code>.jpg</code> pattern a designer included in without realizing that would ruin the idea of a scalable vector…</p>\\n<p>From there there are great tools that can take things further like <a href=\\\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\\\">SVGOMG - SVGO’s Missing GUI</a>, but perhaps we were too liberal with trust in the compressor for handling our SVGs. Sometimes it’s better to be exporting by hand. SVG compressors tend to copy similar elements and use <code>link</code> to be frugal with space. The problem with this is that a good number of times we couldn’t debug in the browser because the usage of <code>link</code>  would place us into the <strong><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\\\">shadow DOM</a></strong>. <em>Insert Stranger things music</em></p>\\n<h2>Personal Pride</h2>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float \\\">\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__text\\\">\\n<p>My favorite portion of the website was figuring out the <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">Machines</a> portion of the site. What made this page interesting was that it was a pretty interactive page with tons of tabs. When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n</span>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__asset\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List Example\\\" width=\\\"439\\\" height=\\\"377\\\">\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It’s nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-fa181.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>ARIA</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you’ll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You’ll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all. So only if someone needed to navigate the website with their keyboard would any tab outlines show.

For those of you that don’t know, Balsamiq Mockups is for making… mockups, but very low-fidelity versions. In fact, I would argue that they are just wireframes at their core.</p>\\n<p>That was when I was just learning how to make websites in my first web design class. Thank God, my teacher encouraged me to hold off on designing a portfolio site early on and point me into a more capable program for high-fidelity designs.</p>\\n<p><em>Sadly, I do not have the old comps from Balsamiq to display. Just know that they looked like poor sketches with bright colors.</em></p>\\n<p>Later on in my junior year, I went through marathon periods of trying to design and code a portfolio for myself and I would never settle on a design.</p>\\n<p>The impossible thing of it all is the acknowledgement that we don’t know how to design for ourselves. We are our own worst critics. As you can see from the listing of projects below, it is quite noticeable how much I self critique myself and my design capabilities.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 182px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 110.98901098901099%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Listing of the MANY coded sites I've made\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Directory of many portfolio attempts\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/431bb091b730170474eb797574f0621e-626fe.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/431bb091b730170474eb797574f0621e-626fe.png 182w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>Each of those directories either denote a new attempted design direction, or an attempt of a feature change.</p>\\n<p>You might ask why not use <code>.git</code> and <code>github</code> to track these different branches/directions?</p>\\n<p>And I’d have to admit that my experience with <code>.git</code> and <code>github</code> were significantly lacking at the time.

I wasn’t good at animation, but I was the only one really doing web animation at my school, so it did place me apart from others around me.</p>\\n<p>After a critique from a bunch of my professors, I realized there was a small U.X. issue with the site as the navigation on the left lead to different pages instead of scrolling to the corresponding sections below.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>This actually wasn’t the next design made. I’m missing a couple of designs from when I used to work on Photoshop, so this is the next I can show. I wanted to see how might my site might look with a lighter color scheme.\\nI’m a pretty effeminate/unmanly man so I thought having a touch of pinkish tones wouldn’t be too bad, albeit color contrast was very problematic, plus a significant amount of other issues.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>I loved this color scheme. My top three favorite colors are black, dark navy blue, and toned red. So this covered part of those and stuck enough with me to an actual live site version.</p>\\n<p>This was actually the last version of my site to be live. I had a slow transition into my internship that I wasn’t able to give it enough love as I originally intended, so I took my site down until I could.</p>\\n<p>I never really did get to showing that rendition more love. And of course I explored more paths.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 155.625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Site V.4\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/175615022605a7725af713583900de8c-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/175615022605a7725af713583900de8c-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/175615022605a7725af713583900de8c-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/175615022605a7725af713583900de8c-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/175615022605a7725af713583900de8c-99f60.png 1200w,\\n/static/175615022605a7725af713583900de8c-22ade.png 1440w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>This was another proposed design from the batch of of site creations that I liked a lot. The only issue with this one is that it got really complicated very fast. Like some of the past designs I had a “Labs” page and a “Work” page. The purpose of the “Labs” page was to showcase <em>experiments</em> and the work page to display actual <em>work</em> that I wanted people to judge me on. This became very messy that it pushed me to try to simplify these pages into one, but I didn’t actually get to do that until my final design (no it’s not the next one)…</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 214.37500000000003%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Site V.5\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-99f60.png 1200w,\\n/static/ac10ecf4aa75e1a4d6de132b28b31502-22ade.png 1440w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p><em>Thoughts behind the design:</em></p>\\n<p>I went back to my favorite color scheme on this one.

Like it’s a pun… and the title of the project.</p>\\n<p>It was an ongoing joke for the project. At Viget, interns aren’t expected to fetch coffee, or do miscellaneous tasks, we were there to learn and create something cool.</p>\\n<p>For this project, I was one of two Front-End Developers on a team of interns with varying roles. On top of the Front-End, we had a copywriter, UX designer, designer, and rails developer.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/8e46de9422495eaabb8b1b1570ee0d00.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\\n<p>We had many lessons learned, but the following highlights a few. On top of it all, we were a team spread over three locations fighting to stay on the same page and to progress forward.</p>\\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\\n<p>Working with a variety of people tends to be a problem when lines aren’t drawn. When you have a specific role, in my case FED. It’s clear that you don’t necessarily have a role in the product direction, but are the one helping build the product.</p>\\n<p>Problem was that each intern, while having specific UX, DESIGN, COPY, FED, and DEV roles, had a say in what we wanted to make.  While it was awesome to have that power, it was hard to collaborate when each intern wanted to take our Coffee website in different directions.</p>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to use an aeropress!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n  We should teach people how to make fancy coffee drinks!\\n</q>\\n<q>\\n<strong>We should teach people how to make good coffee with the tools they already have.</strong>\\n</q>\\n<p>In the end, we each learned to show a little compromise and rally around our unifying idea, <strong>coffee</strong>.</p>\\n<h4>Two FEDs?!</h4>\\n<p>An aspect of this collaboration issue was that there were two front-end developers for the intern class.</p>\\n<p>Initially, my worry was that there would be problems of workload and someone else would be getting to code the part of the website that the other wanted to. This didn’t end up being the case. The other Front-End developer, Cyron, was great to work with. We had great back and forths that made the project smooth to work on.</p>\\n<p>Time did end up becoming an issue, as our designer had a family reunion in a another timezone that couldn’t be avoided in the middle of her design phase, but despite this, she still worked hard in providing us the comps that we needed.</p>\\n<h4>Git Gud</h4>\\n<p>There was an aspect of Git that I never really tackled before. I knew how to setup a project, commit, push, and pull, but soon realized I didn’t know much about Git in the context of a team.</p>\\n<p>It all came down to one command that at least two of the three total developers didn’t use as much <code>git rebase [branch]</code>.</p>\\n<p>We ran into issues early on where rebasing became a long overdrawn process and we would have two or three people on a call just going through all the merge conflicts created in the process. </p>\\n<p>Eventually, we all got on the same page with <code>git</code> usage in the project and things started to go smoothly 👌🏾.</p>\\n<h3>SVG</h3>\\n<p>Our biggest time-consumer for the FED build cycle were working with SVGs.</p>\\n<p>The first issue was getting everyone on the same page about SVGs. At the start of the project, we knew we wanted to use them for animation as we originally intended the site to be performant, but there was a FED/Designer divide on how to go about these SVGs. Common issues with SVG handoffs seems to deal with how many node-points a path has, layer naming, flattening of paths, and random things in between. Plus when you’re going to be animating something, there is a need for the SVG file to be accounting for any animation.</p>\\n<p>With that was the issue of SVG programs. The original vectors were created with Illustrator CC, but to work with the files, the FEDs were limited to Figma. I even took them from Illustrator and brought them into Sketch. This created huge problems as we didn’t know about it at the time, each program handled SVG exports slightly differently.</p>\\n<p><em>Here’s a good podcast from <a href=\\\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/270-svg-sketch-peter-nowell/\\\">Shoptalk</a> that discusses this a little bit.</em></p>\\n<p>Among our issues, when it came time to finally get our animations working, they had issues rendering in specific browsers. Chrome for example would render out one of our SVGs into looking like it exploded into sharp shards while Safari rendered normally. In the end, we removed the unreliable SVGs and kept the ones the worked well due to the time we had left.</p>\\n<p>The whole experience of working with SVGs on this project sure makes me want to reread Chris Coyier’s book <a href=\\\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\\\">Practical SVG</a>.</p>\\n<p>This also made me realize that it’s best to minimize SVGs by hand. Well, after getting a decent export. In Illustrator/Sketch/Figma/whatever, there are tons of different ways of compressing your SVG, whether that’s combining paths, flattening paths/layers, or just removing unnecessary things like that raster <code>.jpg</code> pattern a designer included in without realizing that would ruin the idea of a scalable vector…</p>\\n<p>From there there are great tools that can take things further like <a href=\\\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\\\">SVGOMG - SVGO’s Missing GUI</a>, but perhaps we were too liberal with trust in the compressor for handling our SVGs. Sometimes it’s better to be exporting by hand. SVG compressors tend to copy similar elements and use <code>link</code> to be frugal with space. The problem with this is that a good number of times we couldn’t debug in the browser because the usage of <code>link</code>  would place us into the <strong><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\\\">shadow DOM</a></strong>. <em>Insert Stranger things music</em></p>\\n<h2>Personal Pride</h2>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float \\\">\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__text\\\">\\n<p>My favorite portion of the website was figuring out the <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">Machines</a> portion of the site. What made this page interesting was that it was a pretty interactive page with tons of tabs. When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n</span>\\n<span class=\\\"md-float--left__asset\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List Example\\\" width=\\\"439\\\" height=\\\"377\\\">\\n</span>\\n</span>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It’s nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-fa181.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>ARIA</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you’ll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You’ll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all. So only if someone needed to navigate the website with their keyboard would any tab outlines show. This was done using Viget’s <a href=\\\"https://ten1seven.github.io/what-input/\\\">WhatInput</a> which allows you to style/create interactions based on the mouse, keyboard, or touch events.</p>\\n<h2>Summary</h2>\\n<p>I’ll probably re-edit this page and provide more examples as I see fit, but here’s a summary of the things FEDs had to tackle in this project:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Collaboration, especially with <code>git</code></li>\\n<li>SVG animations and debugging those animations.</li>\\n<li>How to make an interactive site accessible.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/137a832215cf994a5fde170d9fe04543.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<p>Some other things I’ll just touch on shortly were two things:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://codepen.io/\\\">Codepen</a> as a tool to quickly prototype ideas and animations.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://getbem.com/naming/\\\">BEM — Block Element Modifier</a> as a method of making our classes more understandable to anyone else working with the project.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If you’re looking for other writings about the execution of this project check out the <a href=\\\"https://www.viget.com/articles/world-meet-ground-rules\\\">introduction of GroundRules</a> by Elyse or a <a href=\\\"http://vivianzwang.com/ground-rules\\\">design case study</a> by Vivian.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/benjaminmodayil/Documents/sites/modayilme_gatsby/src/pages/posts/work/09-22-2017-second-blog.1/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"layout\":\"work\",\"title\":\"Ground Rules  <span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"\\\">☕</span> \",\"tldr\":\"Interns make a site showing others how to make their own coffee\",\"path\":\"/work/ground-rules\",\"type\":\"work\",\"external\":null,\"_PARENT\":\"SOURCE\"},\"_PARENT\":\"SOURCE\"},\"next\":{\"html\":\"<h2>To learn Javascript</h2>\\n<p>Around my Junior year of college, I wanted to learn Javascript.

Secondary, was to create a somewhat coherent story, which I did, but in an “episode” format.  So in reality, the game feels short, but it is as most “episode” like games tend to be.</p>\\n<p>One of the difficulties was figuring out the best way of storing game data. I wanted to at the time explore using JSON files, but I honestly just didn’t get Javascript that much at the time to do this, and in the end, I just stored the game text/options in the same <code>.JS</code> file.</p>\\n<img src=\\\"/d149198da05635814a5096f38857c235.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Game Intro\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%\\\" width=\\\"331\\\" height=\\\"539\\\">\\n<p>Looking back, there’s a ton of things that I could have done better, but that’s the ongoing issue with development:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>There’s always something that can be done better, but do you have the time or knowledge to make it better?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>My issue was mainly the latter, knowledge.

Secondary, was to create a somewhat coherent story, which I did, but in an “episode” format.  So in reality, the game feels short, but it is as most “episode” like games tend to be.</p>\\n<p>One of the difficulties was figuring out the best way of storing game data. I wanted to at the time explore using JSON files, but I honestly just didn’t get Javascript that much at the time to do this, and in the end, I just stored the game text/options in the same <code>.JS</code> file.</p>\\n<img src=\\\"/d149198da05635814a5096f38857c235.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Game Intro\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%\\\" width=\\\"331\\\" height=\\\"539\\\">\\n<p>Looking back, there’s a ton of things that I could have done better, but that’s the ongoing issue with development:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>There’s always something that can be done better, but do you have the time or knowledge to make it better?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>My issue was mainly the latter, knowledge. Because of this, my plan is to add to this project with the knowledge I have now of better patterns within Javascript.</p>\\n<h2>Struggles</h2>\\n<p>Two struggles were precedent throughout the project.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Learning Javascript.</li>\\n<li>Writing a decent story and mapping out choice logic.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Here are some screenshots of the latter:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 58.90736342042756%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Mind-Node - plotting game option logic\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/b6e0e19a2773c21028eaf0a5f5dedf43-79fcd.png 842w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 53.90909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA/UlEQVQoz6WSzW6DMBCE8/4P1ktvOfTSJiUJNgbW9tpL0uPUPyKqSlBRcxh5BcvH7ox3+uigG0oawU4wfU1PaTcXbAXqQBgN31+aQ0Cv3OrHQQLiNT4GznKmTimTwA8CuQlsJ2UL9TmWuj97tG8OH68G1DM4BpAnWLbrQE+C4AXUVujvPrlK6c2yP84lsE+rJz9Pe4vmJTXpBNWxTEc6WXBmdCdKsmCO6x4uwEOdLgOz8srmQttDWRjOFZTPf6X80KOhQh17+OifA84BRamG52u12MKnq9USOMRtQPXuUhgDhpZLUKVWDFKxhEKX+sO8zSbgX8p2dI2Fo3B/9g2QDUnVRRaX6AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Mind-Node - plotting story logic\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/22dcb5d725dea95ae72dccac3a3a6323-678d4.png 1100w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h2>Here’s a little sneak peak</h2>\\n<p>Below <span role=\\\"img\\\" aria-label=\\\"point down\\\"></span>👇🏾 is a preview of a little redesign of the project that I’m working through.
