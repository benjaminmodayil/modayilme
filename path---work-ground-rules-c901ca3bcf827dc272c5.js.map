This didn‚Äôt end up being the case. The other Front-End developer, Cyron, was great to work with.

At the start of the project, we knew we wanted to use them for animation as we originally intended the site to be performant, but there was a FED/Designer divide on how to go about these SVGs. Common issues with SVG handoffs seems to deal with how many node-points a path has, layer naming, flattening of paths, and random things in between. Plus when you‚Äôre going to be animating something, there is a need for the SVG file to be accounting for any animation.</p>\\n<p>With that was the issue of SVG programs. The original vectors were created with Illustrator CC, but to work with the files, the FEDs were limited to Figma. I even took them from Illustrator and brought them into Sketch. This created huge problems as we didn‚Äôt know about it at the time, each program handled SVG exports slightly differently.</p>\\n<p>*Here‚Äôs a good podcast from <strong>Shoptalk</strong> that discuss this a little bit*: <a href=\\\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/270-svg-sketch-peter-nowell/\\\">Link</a></p>\\n<p>Among our issues, when it came time to finally get our animations working, they had issues rendering in specific browsers. Chrome for example would render out one of our SVGs into looking like it exploded into sharp shards while Safari rendered normally. In the end, we removed the unreliable SVGs and kept the ones the worked well due to the time we had left.</p>\\n<p>The whole experience of working with SVGs on this project sure makes me want to reread Chris Coyier‚Äôs book <a href=\\\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\\\">Practical SVG</a>.</p>\\n<p>This also made me realize that it‚Äôs best to minimize SVGs by hand. Well, after getting a decent export. In Illustrator/Sketch/Figma/whatever, there are tons of different ways of compressing your SVG, whether that‚Äôs combining paths, flattening paths/layers, or just removing unnecessary things like that raster <code>.jpg</code> pattern a designer included in without realizing that would ruin the idea of a scalable vector‚Ä¶</p>\\n<p>From there there are great tools that can take things further like <a href=\\\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\\\">SVGOMG - SVGO‚Äôs Missing GUI</a>, but perhaps we were too liberal with trust in the compressor for handling our SVGs. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be exporting by hand. SVG compressors tend to copy similar elements and use <code>link</code> to be frugal with space. The problem with this is that a good number of times we couldn‚Äôt debug in the browser because the usage of <code>link</code>  would place us into the <strong><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\\\">shadow DOM</a></strong>. <em>Insert Stranger things music</em></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"personal-pride\\\"><a href=\\\"#personal-pride\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Personal Pride</h2>\\n<p>My favorite portion of the website was figuring out the <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">Machines</a> portion of the site. What made this page interesting was that it was a pretty interactive page with tons of tabs. When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It‚Äôs nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-fa181.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"accessibility\\\"><a href=\\\"#accessibility\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>aria</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you‚Äôll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You‚Äôll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all.

This didn‚Äôt end up being the case. The other Front-End developer, Cyron, was great to work with. We had great back and forths that made the project smooth to work on.</p>\\n<p>Time did end up becoming an issue, as our designer had a family reunion to China that couldn‚Äôt be avoided in the middle of her design phase, but despite this, she still worked hard in providing us the comps that we needed.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"git-gud\\\"><a href=\\\"#git-gud\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Git Gud</h4>\\n<p>There was an aspect of Git that I never really tackled before.

At the start of the project, we knew we wanted to use them for animation as we originally intended the site to be performant, but there was a FED/Designer divide on how to go about these SVGs. Common issues with SVG handoffs seems to deal with how many node-points a path has, layer naming, flattening of paths, and random things in between. Plus when you‚Äôre going to be animating something, there is a need for the SVG file to be accounting for any animation.</p>\\n<p>With that was the issue of SVG programs. The original vectors were created with Illustrator CC, but to work with the files, the FEDs were limited to Figma. I even took them from Illustrator and brought them into Sketch. This created huge problems as we didn‚Äôt know about it at the time, each program handled SVG exports slightly differently.</p>\\n<p>*Here‚Äôs a good podcast from <strong>Shoptalk</strong> that discuss this a little bit*: <a href=\\\"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/270-svg-sketch-peter-nowell/\\\">Link</a></p>\\n<p>Among our issues, when it came time to finally get our animations working, they had issues rendering in specific browsers. Chrome for example would render out one of our SVGs into looking like it exploded into sharp shards while Safari rendered normally. In the end, we removed the unreliable SVGs and kept the ones the worked well due to the time we had left.</p>\\n<p>The whole experience of working with SVGs on this project sure makes me want to reread Chris Coyier‚Äôs book <a href=\\\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\\\">Practical SVG</a>.</p>\\n<p>This also made me realize that it‚Äôs best to minimize SVGs by hand. Well, after getting a decent export. In Illustrator/Sketch/Figma/whatever, there are tons of different ways of compressing your SVG, whether that‚Äôs combining paths, flattening paths/layers, or just removing unnecessary things like that raster <code>.jpg</code> pattern a designer included in without realizing that would ruin the idea of a scalable vector‚Ä¶</p>\\n<p>From there there are great tools that can take things further like <a href=\\\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\\\">SVGOMG - SVGO‚Äôs Missing GUI</a>, but perhaps we were too liberal with trust in the compressor for handling our SVGs. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be exporting by hand. SVG compressors tend to copy similar elements and use <code>link</code> to be frugal with space. The problem with this is that a good number of times we couldn‚Äôt debug in the browser because the usage of <code>link</code>  would place us into the <strong><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\\\">shadow DOM</a></strong>. <em>Insert Stranger things music</em></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"personal-pride\\\"><a href=\\\"#personal-pride\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Personal Pride</h2>\\n<p>My favorite portion of the website was figuring out the <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">Machines</a> portion of the site. What made this page interesting was that it was a pretty interactive page with tons of tabs. When one of the machines were clicked, they would bring up an interactive problem statements that could be clicked on and allow a user to peer within for an answer and even for some of these problem statements were cute coffee-related animations.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/e868e0b99d9efdeec6eff32569e81af1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"List example\\\"></p>\\n<p>An interesting issue for this page was to find a way to respect the reading order of the list items. The order of items the designer gave was a top to down then left to right ordering of list items. When using floats, you need to be working with a left to right then top to down approach. The designer was totally okay with changing the order of items to work with the limitations of using floats, but I figure out a way of using rails templating to preserve the order by rendering two lists based on the data coming from our ActiveAdmin CMS/DB. It‚Äôs nothing anyone would notice, but felt like a great solution to a tricky ordering solution that could only be solved with templating.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 26.20817843866171%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQY062P2woDIRBD/f8ftTrjKoJ4QU11YJctfSlsAweDBJJRpRSQtSAiGGPAzOJ5EULA1hgDKSX5f60MEcM5B2tJ/KmdU3NOMff3Caq1BpY2C394WbiJMX4055xljVm5fcmxst573HUt/Ceq1iqNG621rOu9fzX/qje7hYcJuUIrjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"List example\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-f3265.png 200w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-d937d.png 400w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-8be62.png 800w,\\n/static/4749f83c75768ad5cad3ddf22235ff9f-fa181.png 1076w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"accessibility\\\"><a href=\\\"#accessibility\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Accessibility</h3>\\n<p>This was my first project that I got to make more accessible. The goals were to make the website more accessible. To do this we used a combination of <code>aria</code>  attributes. If you check out the machines <a href=\\\"https://groundrules.co/devices\\\">page</a> you‚Äôll notice that you can tab all the way through the page. </p>\\n<p>You‚Äôll probably notice the red outline or dotted outline when selecting elements with the keyboard. If you were to select another element with your mouse there is no outline. Why do this differently for alternate inputs? Because apparently the outline was too ugly. So this was the FED approach to still incorporate accessibility despite feedback to having any outline at all. So only if someone needed to navigate the website with their keyboard would any tab outlines show.
